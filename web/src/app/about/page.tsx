            Luminous Gems was founded on the belief that jewelry should feel as
            good as it looks. We partner with small-scale miners to source
            conflict-free gemstones and work exclusively with recycled gold and
            silver. Each piece is designed in our Brooklyn atelier where master
            artisans combine heritage techniques with contemporary sensibilities.
          </p>

            Our collections are inspired by architecture, fine art, and the
            stories shared by our customers. From engagement rings to bespoke
            heirloom redesigns, we craft jewelry that reflects the individuality
            of the wearer.
